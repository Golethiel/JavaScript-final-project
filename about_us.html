        <p>The Travel Guide started out as just one man, James Fletcher.
        He was very familiar with the airline companies, and he was
        the go-to guy for booking affordable flights and finding deals
        in hotels. The company has expanded on his simple vision of
        doing the hard part of vacation, the planning, and turning
        it into a platform that anybody can use. What is your
        vacation destination? That is and will be our vision for many years.
